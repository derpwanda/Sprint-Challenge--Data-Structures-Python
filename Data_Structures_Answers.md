Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
    O(n)

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
    O(n)

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?


5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? 
    The runtime is O(n**2) due to the two for loops. The final comparison doesn't add to the runtime.

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    The spacetime is O(n).

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    The runtime complexity is O(n)


8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    The spacetime is O(c).
