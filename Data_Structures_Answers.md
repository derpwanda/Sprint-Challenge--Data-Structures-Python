Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
    O(n)

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
    O(n)


3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?


5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? 
    The runtime is O(log n) due to the two for loops. The final comparison doesn't add to the runtime.

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    The spacetime is O(n) because we are creating/adding to a new list, duplicates.

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?


8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
